Overview
The system is aa JWT accessible web service that requires a user to login to request any service. It was built using a MVC framework The three services implemented in the system are as follows:
1.Service 1: Get All Books.
•	User is not required to enter a parameter.
•	Is available to all users with an api key
2.Service 2: Get Books by Category
•	User is required to enter a category the want to search books.
•	Is only available to users who have a premium membership.
3.Service 3: Get Books by Date
